## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Looking more closely at the data

``` r
agg_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Let’s start by doing a `prop.test()` for one city.

``` r
prop.test(
  agg_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  agg_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)
    ) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Let’s iterate this

``` r
results_df = 
  agg_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Making a graph

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Loading in 20 datasets and tidying data.

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
  path = list.files(path = "lda_data")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
         data = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  mutate(arm_id = recode(path, "lda_data/con_01.csv" = "control_01", "lda_data/con_02.csv" = "control_02", "lda_data/con_03.csv" = "control_03", "lda_data/con_04.csv" = "control_04", "lda_data/con_05.csv" = "control_05", "lda_data/con_06.csv" = "control_06", "lda_data/con_07.csv" = "control_07", "lda_data/con_08.csv" = "control_08", "lda_data/con_09.csv" = "control_09", "lda_data/con_10.csv" = "control_10", "lda_data/exp_01.csv" = "experimental_01", "lda_data/exp_02.csv" = "experimental_02", "lda_data/exp_03.csv" = "experimental_03", "lda_data/exp_04.csv" = "experimental_04", "lda_data/exp_05.csv" = "experimental_05", "lda_data/exp_06.csv" = "experimental_06", "lda_data/exp_07.csv" = "experimental_07", "lda_data/exp_08.csv" = "experimental_08", "lda_data/exp_09.csv" = "experimental_09", "lda_data/exp_10.csv" = "experimental_10",)) %>% 
  separate(arm_id, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_", convert = T) %>% 
  select(-path) %>% 
   select(arm, subject_id, everything()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8,
               names_to = "week",
               names_prefix = "week_",
               values_to = "observations"
  )
```

The experimental group of subjects seemed to have the observed values
increase over the eight weeks, while the control group on the whole did
not appear to have much meaningful change in observed values. Some
subjects in the control group appeared to have an increase in values,
while others had decreasing values, and still others had values that
remained the same across the eight weeks of observations. The range of
starting values for the control group seemed closer together as compared
to the experimental group, which seemed to have a wider range of
starting observed values.
